# React Native E-commerce App

As part of my React Native training at CESI in Rouen, we were asked to create an e-commerce application. This includes a list of products (dummy list created in a base API), a details page for each product, the ability to add a product to the Cart, and of course viewing the Cart page with the ability to remove an item in the Cart or to modify its quantity.

## API Reference

#### Get all products

```http
  GET /api/products
```

| Parameter |
| :-------- |
| `None` |

## Installation

Terminal 1:
```bash
    cd react-native-ecommerce-app
    npm i
    npx expo start
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
    cd api
    npm i
    npm start
```

You have to use ngrok to access to API, don't forget to replace the API's root with the ngrok token. ([Read the doc](https://ngrok.com/docs))
